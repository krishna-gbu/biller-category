🔹 **STEP 3: Format Output**

Return the results in a table format with the following columns:

| Date       | Merchant Name         | Amount (₹) | Category     |
|------------|------------------------|------------|--------------|

🔹 **IMPORTANT FORMATTING RULES:**

1. **Sort by Date**: Sort all transactions by date (ascending order)

2. **Visual Date Grouping**: 
   - Show the date ONLY in the first row for each date group
   - Leave the date column BLANK in subsequent rows for the same date
   - This simulates merged cells in a spreadsheet

3. **Amount Formatting**: 
   - Format all amounts with 2 decimal places
   - Include the ₹ symbol before each amount
   - Example: ₹1,250.00

4. **Clean Output**: 
   - Do not include any explanations, headings, or extra text
   - Return ONLY the final markdown table

**Example of correct formatting:**
| Date       | Merchant Name         | Amount (₹) | Category     |
|------------|------------------------|------------|--------------|
| 01/01/2024 | Restaurant ABC        | ₹500.00    | Food & Dining|
